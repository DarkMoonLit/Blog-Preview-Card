## Overview
This is a blog preview card using HTML, CSS and Flex box.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://darkmoonlit.github.io/Blog-Preview-Card/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learnt how to create the classes in HTML more effectively so that I can target any particular changes that will be brought with CSS. 
I have learnt some new components with CSS namely outline, box shadow, float and hover.

.title:hover {
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}


### Continued development

I am getting used to using Flex box for my screen layouts. My foundation on HTML and CSS is getting stronger and I just need to continue learning the different components of CSS and increase my code readability.
